    The dissimilarity measure relies on the premise that adjacent jigsaw pieces
    in the original image tend to share similar colors along their abutting
    edges, i.e., the sum (over all neighboring pixels) of squared color
    differences (over all three color bands) should be minimal. Let pieces pi ,
    pj be represented in normalized L*a*b* space by corresponding W x W x 3
    matrices, where W is the height/width of each piece (in pixels).
